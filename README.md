# MIOCSV

A lightweight and fast CSV reader and writer built upon [MIO](https://github.com/wxinix/MIO). This is our first step to rebuild [DTALite](https://github.com/asu-trans-ai-lab/DTALite) using modern C++.

The string split algorithm is adopt from [CSVparser](https://github.com/rsylvian/CSVparser) with enhancement to support double quotes. Thanks to its original author for this elegant piece!
